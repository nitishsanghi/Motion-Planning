# A* and Variants with OPENRAVE simulation environment

Path finding for mobile robots is a basic problem which can be solved using a informed search algorithm like A* or its variants. In this project A* and AN* are implemented in python and interfaced with OPENRAVE simulation environment. A* is guaranteed to find the shortest path between two points but can be time consuming. AN* is an iterative version of A* which quickly finds and returns a path and can iteratively improve upon the path to find the optimal path. The gif illustration below is for A* path found and simulated in OPENRAVE.
